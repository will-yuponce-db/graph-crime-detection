## Current data gaps

**None currently tracked in this file.**

This document is intentionally kept **empty of resolved items** (we delete entries once fixed) so it only represents _open_ gaps.

### Template (add new gaps here)

- **gap**: <what’s missing?>
  - **impact**: <what the UI/workflow can’t do without it>
  - **owner**: <who/where to fix: backend, Databricks table, UI, etc.>
  - **notes**: <links, queries, screenshots>
